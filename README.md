 Job Application Letter

This project contains a Job Application Letter designed using HTML and CSS.  
It demonstrates the use of basic text tags and various CSS styling techniques.


Features
- HTML: Uses standard text formatting tags such as `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<u>`, and `<blockquote>`.  
- CSS: Styling is applied in three ways:
  - Inline CSS (inside the `<style>` tag in the HTML file)
  - Internal CSS (inside the `<head>` section)
  - External CSS (linked through `job.css`)

- Typography & Layout:
  - Uses Google Fonts and basic text styles.
  - Implements a responsive container with a box-shadow effect.
  - Highlights key elements with color and styling.

How to Run

2. Open the `job letter assignment 1.html` file in a browser.  
3. Ensure `job.css` is in the same directory for external styling to work.
